# deep-nn-examples

This repository contains toy examples of shallow and deep neural networks along with convolutional and recurrent neural networks.
It also contains a (not optimal) implementation of base neural networks.
Have fun! :)

## Usage
You can either run the examples from command line or from an IDE. The below examples are for command line usage.

### Setup
First set up the environment by running the setup.py file for installation. It will download all the necessary packages to run the examples.

```
> python setup.py install
```

### Run example

```
> python NeuralNetworks/logisticregression_vs_shallownn.py
```

## List of examples:

This is the list of finished examples.. others will follow and also a description for them..

* Simple linear regression
* Logistic regression vs shallow neural networks
* Shallow neural networks vs "deeper" neural networks
